this directory is to learn git

1. create directory in you git account
2. in terminal type
   $git init
   $git clone <url>
3. create some files and save them as usual
4. $git add <file_name>
   $git commit <file_name> -m '<message'
   $git push
   your profile name
   your password of github
5. do some changes in your file
   $git status
    your file is red
   $git checkout -- <file>
    this returns the previous status and delete
    the changes in <work_file>
6. do meaningless changes with your file
  $git add <file_name>
  $git commit <file_name> -m '<message'
  $git push

  now there are 2 commits in remote repo

  If we want to remove any remote commit

  $git rebase -i <ssh>
  there will be messages, you can change the word
  pick with the word drop where you want, and
  those commits will be removed from the LOCAL
  history, we need to do
  $git push -f
  and that will rewrite the remote history
  with the local one
7. $ git reset <file>
   this makes added file to modified without changing
   <work_file>
8. $git rebase -i HEAD~3
   gives a chance to change the last 3 commits
9. $git commit --amend
   gives a chance to change the last commit message
10. $git rebase --abort
    cancel the rebase
