this directory is to learn git
0.prettier --single-quote --jsx-bracket-same-line --write ....files
1. let's create directory in your git account
2. in terminal type
   $git init
   $git clone <url>
3. create some files and save them as usual
4. $git add <file_name>
   $git commit <file_name> -m '<message'
   $git push
    my profile name
   my password of github
5. do some changes in your file
   $git status
    if my file is red
   $git checkout -- <file>
    this returns the previous status and delete
    the changes in <work_file>
   $git checkout .
       this returns the previous status for all the files
6. do meaningless changes with my file
  $git add <file_name>
  $git commit <file_name> -m '<message'
  $git push

  now there are 2 commits in remote repo

  If we want to remove any remote commit

  $git rebase -i <ssh>
  there are messages, we can change the word
  'pick' with the word drop where you want, and
  those commits will be removed from the LOCAL
  history,then we need to do
  $git push -f
  and that will rewrite the remote history
  with the local one
7. $ git reset <file>
   this makes added file to modified without changing
   <work_file>
8. $git rebase -i HEAD~3
   gives a chance to change the last 3 commits
9. $git commit --amend
   gives a chance to change the last commit message
10. $git rebase --abort
    cancel the rebase
11. if we deleted some local files we can get back them
    $ git checkout -f HEAD
12.  $ git log -S<WORD>
   Will give you all the commits which include that word
